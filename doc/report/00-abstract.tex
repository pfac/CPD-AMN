This document describes the application of the simulated annealing technique to solve the Room Assignment problem and presents a study to prove its effectiveness. Two implementations are presented, a sequential one and a parallel one using MPI. In the parallel implementation, multiple independent processes solve the problem and only the best computed solution is considered. Tests using a manually injected perfect solution proved this technique to improve considerably the results of the basic approach for different numbers of students, specially using multiple parallel processes. Variations in the initial temperature were proven to affect mainly the convergence of the method.
