This document describes the application of the simulated annealing technique to solve the Room Assignment problem and presents a study to prove its effectiveness. Two implementations are presented, a sequential one and a parallel one using MPI. Both solve the problem for an incompatibilities matrix generated in the beginning using both approaches. In the parallel implementation, multiple independent processes solve the problem and only the best computed solution is considered. Tests using a manually injected perfect solution proved this technique to improve considerably the results of the basic approach, specially using multiple parallel processes.
