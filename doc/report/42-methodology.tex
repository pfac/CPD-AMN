\subsection{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

The two described versions of the implementation described in this document were measured separately with the same methodology. Both were measured for different values of $n$ from 40 to 200 with a step of 4, with only one execution, and the approach with simulated annealing was tested using $T_{0}=1$ and $T_{0}=10$. For each pair of $(n,T_{0})$, only one execution was performed.

The distributed memory version was also tested using different numbers of processes, until the maximum hardware threads available in the SeARCH Group Hex.
